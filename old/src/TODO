#IGOR

- jump. we did not test it again after fixed the button issue
- crouch detection (System should be able to recognise when the human is going down to crouch - verical movement) / maybe use external cameras
- vr driver injection
- create gui
- wireless system
- lateral movement bug. I move for ex right and I see that when I reach the farthese position, if Ikeep moving right, the dot goes in crazy positions. I can show you. Would like to understadnd how I can fine tune that and if maybe can be added such fine tuning in gthe seting.
- optimize walk/run algorithm / continue fine tuning code for locomotion features
- add indication for calibrating

a) when I move backwards, even if I just slide flat my feet on the floor back, the accelerometer pick up that movement as a walk forward. Wonder if we can find a solution for it so that accelerometer does not pick up walking when I move backwards

b) might find more after deep testing in games

STACK:
- usb injection (https://github.com/TrueOpenVR/TrueOpenVR-Drivers)  
- GUI for smoother configuration of the system

#MARCO

- need to test dependency of the chest running algorithm with the issue
